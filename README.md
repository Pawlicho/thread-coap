# Development of Thread application using nRF5x

## About

The aim of the project is to develop a prototype of a sample home or building automation system utilizing the Thread protocol stack. The system has been implemented on one of the Nordic Semiconductor nRF5x series platforms, using tools provided by the manufacturer. The final stage of the project involves demonstrating the operation of the system based on at least 5 nRF5x devices and analyzing the hardware resource requirements, particularly memory, necessary to run the Thread stack on the utilized platform.
